This repository demonstrates a common SQL error involving `COUNT(*)` with `GROUP BY` and the handling of NULL values, along with implicit type conversion issues. The `bug.sql` file shows the incorrect query, while `bugSolution.sql` provides the corrected version.  The error is demonstrated in how `COUNT(*)` behaves with `GROUP BY` when dealing with `NULL` values in the grouping columns.  The solution focuses on handling NULLs correctly to avoid inflated counts and using explicit type conversions to prevent unexpected behavior.  This repository aims to highlight a subtle yet important aspect of SQL query writing that often leads to unexpected results.
